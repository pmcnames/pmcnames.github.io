            <p>This is a digital zine about how you can physically document your personal experiences for the sake of
                future recollection.</p>
            <p>If you've ever read childhood journal entries, you know the joy of getting a glimpse into the inner
                workings of your young mind. Reminiscing can bring up strange, surprising, and sometimes bittersweet
                feelings. You might realize how disconnected you are from that side of yourself now, or simply enjoy the
                reminder of how carefree you used to be. Saving these items helps repair the fragile connection between
                past and present.</p>
            <p>In fifteen years, how well will you understand your present self? You may remember the names of friends,
                experiences that stand out in your mind, the general layout of your current dwelling. But will you know
                what was important to you? What you did on a day-to-day basis? What you struggled with? It’s easy to
                lose track of who you used to be, despite its fundamental connection to who you’ve become.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six-columns">
            <p>
                Consider what you currently have to look back on. Your phone’s camera roll, Spotify playlists, Pinterest
                boards, social media feeds... Does this paint an accurate picture of your life? With many of these being
                public, how will you understand who you were when you weren’t performing for other people? With the
                digital dark age upon us, these things could easily be lost to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, digital media fails to maintain all the sensory elements of physical media. Objects
                contain textures, smells, sometimes even tastes that bring back richer memories.

                I recommend trying whatever formats appeal to you and combining them as needed. Personally I keep a
                combined journal / commonplace / scrapbook, a sketchbook, two small notebooks (one next to my bed for
                late-night ideas, one in my bag for when I’m out on the town), and separate collections of letters,
                recipes, etc. It’s an imperfect and constantly evolving system.

                I started journaling a few years ago after reading part of The Artist’s Way. Julia Cameron suggests
                doing “Morning Pages” at the beginning every day as part of a routine to promote creativity. The goal is
                to create a direct mind-to-page pathway without pause for thought. You write absolutely whatever comes
                to mind in real time, even if that means stopping in the middle of a sentence to begin another thought.
                Even if it’s just nonsense. I found that I almost always wrote about recent events because that was
                simply the easiest thing to do. The more you allow yourself to create freely without criticizing, the
                easier it becomes. Make it messy. Let it be a pile of cringe-worthy garbage. You’ll still be glad you
                took the time to write it down. 
                There are a lot of benefits to writing as a means of processing your emotions, but I’ll resist the urge
                to preach about this. I’ll just say that beyond its historical value, it’s a great way to self-regulate
                and grow.

                There are endless lists of journal prompts online, though I think the best way is to just write whatever
                comes to the surface. Regardless, here are a few ideas to use as a jumping off point.

                Personally, I like to intersperse my journal entries with lists, quotes, notes, ideas, poems, logs, etc.
                But if you prefer, you could keep a separate “Commonplace Book” for these things. The idea is just to
                write down anything that interests you. Don’t overthink it, they don’t have to be deep or even
                meaningful. I sometimes like to write things down that don’t entirely make sense to me in hopes that
                someday they will.

                Unfortunately (for scrapbookers) a lot of physical ephemera has been replaced with digital alternatives.
                But lucky for us, we’ll always have trash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Garbage can be a really interesting window into another time period. My grandma has a book crammed full
                of recipes cut out from 1950s magazines and packaging. I find it absolutely fascinating to see what
                people ate back then, and in many ways I feel like it helped understand her better. 
            </p>
            <p>

                I like to hold onto garbage I find aesthetically pleasing or sentimentally significant, such as small
                flyers, tags, and wrappers.

                If you like to draw, it can also be a great way to capture moments that otherwise go forgotten. I
                sometimes like to make one-page comics about my day. I’ll draw a panel about an overheard conversation,
                something I thought about while gazing at a view, the outfit I wore. These are some of the days I
                remember most clearly because I took the time to do so. For more examples of this, look up Hourly Comics
                Day!

                Portraits are a nice way to capture a friend’s essence. Drawings are sometimes a more accurate
                representation of a person’s presence than photographs.

                The same is true for environments. Draw your bedroom, your favorite tree, your workplace, your favorite
                coffee shop. The act of drawing from life requires you to slow down and carefully observe your
                surroundings. This level of presence and focus is hard to come by in today’s fast-paced world.
            </p>
            <p>
                It doesn’t have to be good. Even better if it isn’t. Sketchbooks come with a feeling of pressure to make
                every page perfect. I like to use an excessive amount of sticky notes and pasted-in paper to give myself
                a second chance at “warm-up” pages. Though if you can tolerate it, your future self will likely enjoy
                every drawing you offer them.

                I like to keep a small pad of paper in my bag to draw and write in while I’m out in the world. It’s a
                nice way to keep my hands busy while waiting for the bus, and it keeps me off my phone. I sometimes tear
                out pages and tape them in my hodgepodge book or sketchbook if I really like them.</p>

                Collaborative works are a lovely activity and way to document relationships. I look back fondly on the
                pieces of paper my elementary school friends and I doodled all over when we were bored in class.

                Zines are a fun way to do this (though you can also make them by yourself, of course.) A zine can be
                about anything you want, and you can scan them and make copies to share. They can contain
                writing, art, collage, etc. I sometimes like to take turns with a friend filling one page at a time,
                passing them back and forth until a story emerges.

                Letters and postcards are a wonderful way to stay in touch with long-distance friends. Phone calls and
                texts have their place, but there’s nothing like the joy of opening a letter. I stayed in touch with
                people this way during the pandemic, and I’m currently penpals with my kid cousins who live in Nova
                Scotia. I plan to hold onto these forever and ever. It’s sort of a unique form of communication because
                you just monologue to each other about your own lives, asking and answering questions here and there.
                Letters can contain other things, too. My cousin and I send each other heavily decorated envelopes full
                of stickers, comics, drawings, bookmarks, buttons, etc.

                life, figure out whatever’s the most enjoyable and sustainable for you. I find a lot of fulfillment and
                comfort in documenting my life, but you might be different. If you’d rather let your brain choose what
                memories to hold on to and leave the rest to the ocean of time, so be it.
